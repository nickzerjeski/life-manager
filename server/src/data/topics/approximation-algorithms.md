# Approximation Algorithms

An overview of algorithms that find near‑optimal solutions to hard optimization problems.
$$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) $$
Includes greedy techniques, linear programming relaxations, and **polynomial‑time** approximation schemes used in theoretical computer science. $a^2+b^2=c^2$ for an inline equation.
